# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in Dart

This folder contains implementations of key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Dart. Each concept is designed to demonstrate fundamental principles of OOP.

## Contents

- **Encapsulation**: This concept involves bundling the data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It also emphasizes restricting direct access to some of an object's components, typically using private variables and public methods.

- **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows one class (the subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (the superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It primarily involves method overriding, where subclasses provide their specific implementations of a method defined in the superclass.

- **Abstraction**: Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object. This is achieved through abstract classes and methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

## Conclusion

Understanding these OOP concepts is essential for developing robust and maintainable software in Dart. Explore the implementations in this folder to deepen your knowledge of these foundational principles.
